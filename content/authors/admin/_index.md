I'm a PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering at NC State University. I have a multidisciplinary background with projects and courses in Electrical Engienering, Material Science, Biomedical devices, Machine Learning and Robotics. My past projects fall into three main research areas: Physical sensors (pressure, shear, strain), Physiological sensors (Bio-impedance, ExG) and Flexible Materials (Textile, Silicone). For my thesis project, I am developing a textile pressure sensor to monitor the comfort and fit of prosthetic limbs. 

Previously, I interned at the [Facebook Reality Labs][1], [Naval Research Labs][2], and [Carnegie Mellon University][3]. 
I graduated from George Mason University with a major in Electrical Engineering (minor in Computer Science). During which time I worked with Dr. Gerald Cook and Dr. Dan Lofaro in the [Lofaro Labs][4].
